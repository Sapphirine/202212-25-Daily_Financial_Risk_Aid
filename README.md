# 202212-25-Daily_Financial_Risk_Aid
Fernando R. (fr2510) Team 202212-25 Daily Financial Risk Aid final project for Columbia University's EECS 6893 Big Data Analytics.

- This repository contains the Google Cloud DAG python files required to run the back-end data acquisition and processing for this Daily Financial Risk Aid project as well as the front-end HTML visualizer.
- The *Daily_Financial_Aid_Final.html* file is the main front end visualizer which is preset to gather the DAG processed financial data from Fernando's public project GitHub repository. 
-  This will allow for the running of the visualizer with the acquired and processed datasets.
  - Please note that the HTML file may need to be "refreshed" once or twice to properly display the D3 graphs.  
-  Further raw dataset info can be obtained at: https://github.com/FernandoEE/EECS6893_Daily_Financial_Aid/tree/main/Financial_Data
- The remaining DAG files should be run on a Google Cloud Ubuntu VM with all of the header dependencies installed and the proper folder naming conventions added to the code.
  - This is due to the code being set with Fernando's VM directory structure. 
- Please note that all of Fernando's secret tokens were removed from the code for security reasons as these are specific to his Twitter and Google Cloud accounts.
  - Please add you own personal tokens for code execution.
